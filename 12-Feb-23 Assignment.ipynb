    "An Exception in Python is an error that occurs during the execution of a Python program. It is an indication that something unexpected or abnormal has occurred, and the normal flow of the program cannot continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a mechanism for detecting and handling exceptions through the use of try-except blocks. When an exception is encountered during the execution of a try block, the control is immediately transferred to the corresponding except block that handles the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exception can be caused by a variety of reasons such as invalid inputs, unexpected behavior, errors in the code, network problems, file access errors, etc. There are many built-in exception types in Python, such as ValueError, TypeError, NameError, ZeroDivisionError, FileNotFoundError, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the built-in exceptions, you can also create your own custom exceptions by defining a new class that inherits from the Exception class. This allows you to create specific exception types that are relevant to your program and provide more detailed information about the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling exceptions properly is an important part of writing robust and error-free Python code. By handling exceptions, you can prevent your program from crashing unexpectedly and provide meaningful error messages to the user."

    "Exceptions and Syntax errors are both types of errors that can occur in a Python program, but they differ in several ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cause: A Syntax error occurs when the Python interpreter detects a mistake in the syntax of the program. For example, if you forget to close a parenthesis or use an incorrect keyword, the interpreter will raise a Syntax error. On the other hand, Exceptions occur during the runtime of the program, when something unexpected happens that causes the program to terminate abruptly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detection: Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter before the program starts running. In contrast, Exceptions are detected during the execution of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling: Syntax errors can be fixed by correcting the syntax mistake in the program. Exceptions, on the other hand, are handled by catching them with try-except blocks and handling them appropriately.\n",
