    "Explaination :- Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential information to the user. It helps in reducing the complexity of the code and improves the maintainability of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example :- let's consider a car. When we drive a car, we don't need to know how the engine works. We just need to know how to turn it on and drive it. This is abstraction. We are only concerned with the essential information, which is how to operate the car, and not the internal details of how the engine works.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOPs, abstraction is implemented through classes and interfaces. A class can have both public and private members. The public members are accessible outside the class, while the private members are hidden from the user. The interface defines only the public members, which must be implemented by the classes that implement the interface.\n",

    "Abstraction and encapsulation are related concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) but they are different in their purpose and implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction, is the process of hiding complex implementation details behind a simpler and more user-friendly interface. It is concerned with representing only the essential information and hiding the implementation details. Abstraction allows the user to focus on what the object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping data and functions within an object, making the data and functions inaccessible to the outside world. Encapsulation is concerned with ensuring that the implementation details of an object are protected from external access and modification, promoting data security and integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a bank account object. Abstraction would hide the implementation details of how the account balance is calculated and updated, and only expose the essential information, such as the account balance and methods for depositing and withdrawing money. Encapsulation would protect the account balance and the methods for depositing and withdrawing money by making them private to the object, so that they cannot be accessed or modified directly from outside the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, abstraction is concerned with hiding complexity, while encapsulation is concerned with hiding data and providing access control to it.\n"
